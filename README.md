# kixi.kafka.s3.backup

This repoository provides a Docker container that will consumer Kafka messages and back them up directly to Amazon S3 bucket. While some may back their messages up while processing we think it's prudent to have a backup consumer consumer group to store the raw messages while processing goes on in another consumer group.
